excerpt: "A brief introduction to my thoughts and writing."

This is my first thought piece. More to come.

Writing is thinking made visible. I use this space to explore ideas about product engineering, design, and the craft of building software.

## What to expect

Short, focused pieces on:

- Product development
- Engineering craft
- Design thinking
- Tools and workflows

Stay tuned.
